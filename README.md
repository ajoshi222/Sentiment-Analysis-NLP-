# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP-
 Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

 #Project objective: The objective of this project is to perform sentimental analysis on a dataset of movie reviews from the IMDB website.
 This will involve using natural language processing techniques to classify each review as either positive or negative. The results of this analysis can be used to gain insights into public opinion about movies, as well as to identify trends in movie reviews over time.
 
 #Data: The data for this project is a CSV file containing 50,000 movie reviews from the IMDB website. The reviews are labeled as either positive or negative.
 
 #Tools and techniques: The following tools and techniques will be used for this project: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as sentiment analysis and text classification Machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression and support vector machines Data visualization tools, such as matplotlib, seaborn and wordclouds. 
 
 #Results: The results of this project will be a report that summarizes the findings of the sentimental analysis. The report will include the following: A description of the data and the NLP techniques that were used The results of the sentiment analysis, including the accuracy of the classification model A discussion of the findings and their implications 3Conclusion: This project will provide you with the opportunity to apply your knowledge of data science to a real-world problem. It will also help you to develop your skills in NLP, machine learning, and data visualization.
